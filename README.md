# Leveraging Data Analytics for Environmental Sustainability
#### This repository demonstrates the application of data analytics for environmental sustainability, focusing on pollution remediation and product management. It includes research conducted with contaminated mining samples from the Davidschacht mining area in Freiberg, Sachsen. The project aims to optimize pollution reduction strategies and enhance sustainable product development by leveraging advanced analytical techniques.
# Case Study
#### Research on contaminated soils from Davidschacht mining area, Freiberg, Sachsen, 09599 (Germany) with Tailing which was in operation from 1951 to 1964. It has an area of approximately 6.3 ha and a volume of approximately 760,000 m3.
# Thesis Topic
#### Effect of soil amendment combination of artificial root exudates and plant growth promoting bacteria on phytoremediation of potential toxic elements in soil
# Thesis Proposal
## Statement of Problem and Purpose of Research:
#### Tailings from mine sites have high concentrations of inorganic pollutants (heavy metals), which lead to contamination of soil, surface, and underground water because of leaching. This creates the possibility for these contaminants to cause harm to living organisms in the environment and affect biodiversity negatively. Therefore, there is the need to remediate these contaminants in the environment to reduce their concentration and if possible, eliminate their chances of being toxic to living organisms. One of such means of remediation involves the use of plants which is called phytoremediation. Several studies on phytoremediation exist but to the best of my knowledge, there is scarce information on the effect of soil amendment with plant growth promoting bacteria combined with varying concentrations of artificial root exudates (ARE) on phytoremediation of heavy metals in soil. Thus, in this study, we set out to elucidate the impact a treatment combination of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and varying ARE concentrations on phytoremediation of heavy metals in tailing soils obtained from Davidschacht (Freiberg) using Zea mays and Fagopyrum esculentum as test plants.
## Planned tasks:
#### • Collection of contaminated soil from Davidschacht mine site, which is characterized by its high pollution with heavy metals (e.g. Cadmium), for use as substrates in controlled greenhouse experiments sample.
#### • Amendment of soil with Rhizovital (a commercially available B. amyloliquefaciens formular) and ARE.
#### • Cultivation of test plants in soils amended with Rhizovital and ARE under controlled conditions in the greenhouse.
#### • Determination of the concentration of trace elements in roots and shoots taken up from the contaminated soil during growth, as well as soil trace element concentrations via ICP-MS measurements.
#### • Determination of Shoot and Root content of trace elements to assess plant potentials for element uptake as influenced by soil amendment.
#### • Investigating the mobility and bioavailability of target elements in the soil applying both single step extraction (using oxalate acid and water as extractant solutions) and sequential extractions.
#### • Data analyses and interpretation
#### • Writing of thesis
## Experimental Design:
#### • 10 replicates of the tailing soil sample will be collected for soil characterization and analysis.
#### • Usage of Rhizovital as plant growth promoting bacteria.
#### • Treatment combinations in the greenhouse as follows:
##### § Rhizovital (0.4ml) and ARE (125% of 20ml) (8 pots, 4 for each test plant)
##### § Rhizovital (0.4ml) and ARE (100% of 20ml) (8 pots, 4 for each test plant)
##### § Rhizovital (0.4ml) and ARE (50% of 20ml) (8 pots, 4 for each test plant)
##### § Rhizovital (0.4ml) and ARE (25% of 20ml) (8 pots, 4 for each test plant)
##### § Control (8 pots, 4 for each test plant)
##### § Rhizovital (0.4ml) (8 pots, 4 for each test plant)
#### • Growth time for plants 10 weeks.
